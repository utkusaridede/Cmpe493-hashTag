Methods

Existing methods of word segmentation are unsuperwised language models. Researches claim that
using multiple corpora, the joint probability model from multiple corpora performs significantly 
better than the individual corpora. Weighted joint probability model with weights is specific to each corpus. Decent approach is to train the weights in a supervised manner using max-margin methods, that is, a machine learning method to make a decision about the boundries of words.
The supervised probability models improve segmentation accuracy over joint probability models. 
Researchers observe that length of segments is an important parameter for word segmentation, and 
incorporating length-specific weights into our model supports the current model.
However the length specific models further improve segmentation accuracy over supervised 
probability models. Another model is maximum-entropy model. Discussion will be held next sections.

All mentioned models try to solve the problems with dynamic programming algorithms. The supervised length specific models have significantly more advencement over unsupervised single corpus and joint probability models. Segmentation of hashtags result in significant improvement in recall on searches for twitter trends.

The machine learning side of the computer science aims to investigate human related behaviours by definition. Computers should be able to learn how to analyze data from background information. There are similar researches about segmentation of sentences, and especially non-spaced words. The motivation of project comes from URL segmentation. URL segmentation brings same study to mind with the
evoluation of technology. The changes in the social media trends lead to extended works. The amount of Web page links are like god's creatures. That is, Web has a link inheritance that is increasing over time. Collecting data from Web links is somehow stable. However, hashtag case needs some time to be imporved and had data inheritance.

All access points or modems have at least one broadcast address to receive 
common messages from users. So that, our broadcast address for that chat 
program was “192.168.144.255”. 

- The steps involved in establishing a socket on the server side are as follows:
- Create a socket with the socket() system call
- Bind the socket to an address using the bind() system call. For a server socket on the Internet, an address consists of a port number on the host machine.
- Listen for connections with the listen() system call
- Accept a connection with the accept() system call. This call typically blocks until a client connects with the server.
- Send and receive data

Twitter is the latest social networking tool which affects everything related to the person.
Twitter allows its users to write at most 140 character long update, it is known off as 
``tweet''. In this research, analyzing segmentation of tweets is our main objective. There are
several researches in English, but not that much in Turkish. Study on the Turkish corpus is
somehow hard to handle, because of the natural language of tools. The usage of the hashtags
differ in country to country, that is, some countries do not know off proper usage of hashtag.
Having more than one word in the hashtag or lapsus calami are misusage and prevent researhes 
to work properly. The other part of the project is analyzing hashtags in the way of linguistics.
Analyzed corpus will give more information about related countries.
