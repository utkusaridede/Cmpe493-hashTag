All access points or modems have at least one broadcast address to receive 
common messages from users. So that, our broadcast address for that chat

- The steps involved in establishing a socket on the server side are as follows:
- Create a socket with the socket() system call

Twitter is the latest social networking tool which affects everything related to the person.
Twitter allows its users to write at most 140 character long update, it is known off as 
``tweet''. In this research, analyzing segmentation of tweets is our main objective. There are
several researches in English, but not that much in Turkish. Study on the Turkish corpus is
somehow hard to handle, because of the natural language of tools. The usage of the hashtags
differ in country to country, that is, some countries do not know off proper usage of hashtag.
Having more than one word in the hashtag or lapsus calami are misusage and prevent researhes 
to work properly. The other part of the project is analyzing hashtags in the way of linguistics.
Analyzed corpus will give more information about related countries.
